# Browser Calculator

This project is a browser-based calculator created as part of a web development learning journey. The calculator combines HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a functional calculator that runs directly in the browser.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), along with decimal numbers and the ability to toggle between positive and negative numbers. It utilizes JavaScript event delegation for efficient event handling, avoiding the need for individual event listeners on each button.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Decimal number support
- Clear function (C button)
- Delete function (DEL button)
- Positive/negative toggle (+/-)
